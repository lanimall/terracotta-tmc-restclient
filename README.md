Author: Fabien Sanglier

## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

First, let's clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/lanimall/terracotta-tmc-restclient.git

```

Then, download [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) which is required to parse the JSON content. Simply save it into the folder.

That should be it.
